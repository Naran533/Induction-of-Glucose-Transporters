Python codes for the studies on the pattern of induction of glucose transporters in *S.cerevisiae*.

The results were obtained using a plate reader.

The data were analysed using two software created by Prof. Peter Swain's lab: <ins>platereader</ins> and <ins>fitOD</ins>.

    <ins>platereader</ins>: for analyzing platereader data and correcting for autofluorescence
  
    <ins>fitOD</ins>: for fitting growth curves and calculating growth statistics; uses Gaussian processes with a neural network covariance function to perform fits

The project was written as the desertation submitted for the MSc Degree in Systems and Synthetic Biology at the University of Edingburgh.
